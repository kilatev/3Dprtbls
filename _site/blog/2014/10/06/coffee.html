<p>So here is my first post.</p>

<p>In search of useful stuff to print i found one little, but interesting thing.</p>

<p>This is coffee bag lid. Not like ordinary clip to close coffee bag, but something special, which canâ€™t be found at shops.</p>

<p>I printed it yesterday and it was easy print. But still not ideal, as not all details fits after printing. But i suspect that it could be my PLA problem.</p>
