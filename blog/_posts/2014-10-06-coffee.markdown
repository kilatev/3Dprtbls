So here is my first post.

In search of useful stuff to print i found one little, but interesting thing.

This is coffee bag lid. Not like ordinary clip to close coffee bag, but something special, which can't be found at shops.

I printed it yesterday and it was easy print. But still not ideal, as not all details fits after printing. But i suspect that it could be my PLA problem.
